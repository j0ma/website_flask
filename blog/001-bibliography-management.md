title: Bibliography management

Today I started look into `papis`, which truly seems like a great command line -based bibliography manager. I really like how DOI and ArXiv links are handled in a way that _just werks_.

However, there is a slight problem. Currently, I have huge `papers` folder that contains a pile of PDFs, named somewhat understandably but often completely lacking metadata, thanks to me first downloading them to `/tmp` and then "printing to a PDF" to save the paper to my collection like a total noob. Obviously, a lot of metadata gets destroyed in that process -- I've definitely noticed e-books having missing incides etc. before, but didn't realize it was this bad. 

So, I'll need to write something that looks up metadata for my PDFs on the internet.
