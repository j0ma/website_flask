But since that kind of covers almost everything, a low-dimensional projection of my interests could be:</p> <ul> <li><strong>representation learning:</strong> instead of word vectors, can we engineer representations for universal linguistic primitives like IPA? what about unicode?</li> <li><strong>low-resource language technology:</strong> what to do when there are (almost) no resources available for a language? can we leverage unsupervised/weakly supervised methods or transfer learning?</li> </ul> <p>Beyond the above, I’m generally curious about bayesian methods in machine learning and the many fields utilizing probabilistic models to solve their problems.</p> <p>I also love well-made visualizations, and strongly believe that we ought to visualize not only raw data, but model inferences and uncertainty as well. I admit I’ve been influenced by <a href="http://www.andrewgelman.com">Andrew Gelman</a> in this regard.</p> </div> <hr /> <tfoot> <tr> <td> © Jonne Sälevä, 2019 || inspired by <a href="https://cfdenton.github.io">cfdenton</a> </td> </tr> </tfoot>
