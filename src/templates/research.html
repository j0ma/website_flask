A low-dimensional projection of my interests could be:</p> <ul> <li><strong>low-resource languages:</strong> what to do when there are (almost) no resources available for a language? can we leverage unsupervised/weakly supervised methods or transfer learning?</li> <li><strong>morphologically rich languages:</strong> what to do when, unlike English, a language is very morphologically rich, and minor morphological changes induce vast changes in meaning? My native Finnish is a great example of such a language.</li> <li><strong>linguistic annotation and resource creation</strong>: how do we efficiently create annotated resources for the vast number of under-resourced languages such that the resources themselves to computerized analysis?</li> <li><strong>representation learning:</strong> instead of word vectors, can we engineer dense representations for universal linguistic primitives like IPA? what about unicode, which would allow operations like <code>ADD-DIACRITIC</code> to be encoded as vectors?</li> </ul> <p>Beyond the above, I’m generally curious about Bayesian methods in machine learning and the many fields utilizing probabilistic models to solve their problems.</p> </div> <hr /> <tfoot> <tr> <td> © Jonne Sälevä, 2019 || inspired by <a href="https://cfdenton.github.io">cfdenton</a> </td> </tr> </tfoot>
