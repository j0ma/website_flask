My native Finnish is a great example of such a language.</li> <li><strong>linguistic annotation and resource creation</strong>: how do we efficiently create annotated resources for the vast number of under-resourced languages such that the resources themselves to computerized analysis?</li> <li><strong>representation learning:</strong> instead of word vectors, can we engineer dense representations for universal linguistic primitives like IPA? what about unicode – could we encode operations like <code>ADD-DIACRITIC</code> as vectors?</li> <li><strong>(bayesian) statistical methodology and model comparison</strong>: how do we <em>really</em> know that model a performed better than model b on some task/dataset?</li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <tfoot> <tr> <td> © Jonne Sälevä, 2019 </td> </tr> </tfoot>
