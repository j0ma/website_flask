Originally from Finland, I've been living in the U.S. for the past few years, and I'm currently studying Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. 

Overall, my long-term goal is to tackle the problem of low-resource languages, and make Machine Learning methods work in tough situations with little to no labeled training data.

## research and teaching

- Teching Assistant, *Ling 160: Mathematical Methods for Linguistics <small>(2019)</small>*
- Research on low-resource NLP/ASR, *Stat 99: Senior Tutorial <small>(2016-2017)</small>* 
- Teaching Fellow, *Stat 139: Introduction to Statistical Modeling <small>(2015)</small>* 
- Research Intern, *CS50: Introduction to Computer Science <small>(2015)</small>* 

## work in industry
