Originally from Finland, I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brandeis University, working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning with [Prof. Constantine Lignos](https://lignos.org).

Research-wise, I'm interested in tackling the problem of low-resource languages, and making machine learning methods work in tough situations with little to no labeled training data.

Prior to Brandeis, I graduated from Harvard College, where I got an A.B. in Statistics with a fair bit of Computer Science, Applied Mathematics and Yiddish thrown into the mix.
