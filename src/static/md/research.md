My main interest lies in human language technology, i.e. the intersection of machine learning and language. 

A low-dimensional projection of my interests could be:

- **low-resource languages:** what to do when there are (almost) no resources available for a language? can we leverage unsupervised/weakly supervised methods or transfer learning?
- **morphologically rich languages:** what to do when, unlike English, a language is very morphologically rich, and minor morphological changes induce vast changes in meaning? My native Finnish is a great example of such a language.
- **linguistic annotation and resource creation**: how do we efficiently create annotated resources for the vast number of under-resourced languages such that the resources themselves to computerized analysis?
- **representation learning:** instead of word vectors, can we engineer dense representations for universal linguistic primitives like IPA? what about unicode -- could we encode operations like `ADD-DIACRITIC` as vectors?
- **(bayesian) statistical methodology and model comparison**: how do we _really_ know that model a performed better than model b on some task/dataset?
