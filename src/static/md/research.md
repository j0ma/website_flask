My main interest lie in the field of human language technology, and generally applying machine learning to language.  Some examples include:

- **low-resource + morphologically rich languages:** how can we have better representations inside, e.g. a neural machine translation model, such that morphology is captured in a systematic way?
- **unsupervised representation learning:** more generally, how can we engineer representations from unlabeled data? can we move beyond point estimates for things like word embeddings?
- **sequence transduction problems**: machine translation, transliteration, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, speech recognition, ...
- **bayesian methods and model comparison**: how can we add interpretable uncertainty estimates to our models? how do we _really_ know that model a performed better than model b on some task/dataset?
