Broadly speaking, I'm interested in statistical machine learning and applying it to language.

- **low-resource + morphologically rich languages:** how can we have better representations inside, e.g. a neural machine translation model, such that morphology is captured in a systematic way?
- **representation learning & latent variable models:** more generally, how can we engineer representations from unlabeled data? can we move beyond point estimates for things like word embeddings? can we use _structured representations_ like graphs instead of mere word vectors?
- **sequence transduction problems**: machine translation, transliteration, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, speech recognition, ...
- **bayesian methods and model comparison**: how can we add interpretable uncertainty estimates to our model evaluation? how do we _really_ know that model a performed better than model b on some task/dataset? what is the _population_ we are trying to generalize to when using _test set error_ as an estimate of _generalization error_?
- **linguistic annotation and resource creation**: how do we efficiently create annotated datasets and other resources for the "long tail" of under-resourced languages?
