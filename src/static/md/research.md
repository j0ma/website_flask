My main interests are machine learning and language. But since that kind of covers almost everything, a low-dimensional projection of my interests could be:

- **representation learning:** instead of word vectors, can we engineer representations for universal linguistic primitives like IPA? what about unicode? 
- **low-resource language technology:** what to do when there are (almost) no resources available for a language? can we leverage unsupervised/weakly supervised methods or transfer learning?

Beyond the above, I'm generally curious about bayesian methods in machine learning and the many fields utilizing probabilistic models to solve their problems.

I also love well-made visualizations, and strongly believe that we ought to visualize not only raw data, but model inferences and uncertainty as well. I admit I've been influenced by [Andrew Gelman](http://www.andrewgelman.com) in this regard.
