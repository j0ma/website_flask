My main interests are machine learning and language. But since that kind of covers almost everything, a low-dimensional projection of my interests could be:

- **representation learning:** how to build models that minimize reliance on expert supervision and domain knowledge? can we be sure of our representations? can we be bayesian and quantify that using probabilities?
- **low-resource speech recognition:** what to do when there are (almost) no resources available for a language?
- **"meta" machine learning:** bayesian optimization in training, hyperparameter selection. also learning-to-learn, like composing primitive operations to learn representations of categories.

Beyond the above, I'm generally curious about bayesian machine learning and the many fields utilizing probabilistic models to solve their problems.

I also love well-made visualizations, and strongly believe that we ought to visualize not only raw data, but model inferences and uncertainty as well. I also like interactive explanations and , and have recently been thinking about research interfaces and workflows, influenced by [Andrew Gelman](https://www.andrewgelman.com) and the recent goings-on of the [Stan project](https://www.mc-stan.org).

Finally, as a product of [open online educational resources](http://www.khanacademy.org) myself, I believe that all of the above can and should be applied to educating people and openly sharing knowledge online.
