Broadly speaking, I'm interested in statistical machine learning and applying it to language.

- **low-resource + morphologically rich languages:**
    - how do we efficiently create annotated datasets and other resources for the "long tail" of under-resourced languages?
    - how can we have better representations inside NMT models such that morphology is captured in a systematic way?
    - can we capture the relatedness of languages using _partial pooling_ and hierarchical Bayes?
- **representation learning & latent variable models:**
    - more generally, how can we learn representations from unlabeled data?
    - can we move beyond point estimates for things like  word embeddings? 
    - can we use _structured representations_ like graphs instead of mere word vectors?
- **bayesian methods and model comparison**:
    - how can we add interpretable uncertainty estimates to our model evaluation? 
    - how do we _really_ know that model a performed better than model b on some task/dataset?
    - what is the _population_ we are trying to generalize to when using _test set error_ as an estimate of _generalization error_?
- **sequence transduction problems**:
    - machine translation, transliteration, text generation, asr, ...
