Here are some projects I am working / have worked on, mostly centered around machine learning, nlp and speech recognition. Feel free to check out the project descriptions, see the rest of my work on [Github](www.github.com/j0ma) and get in touch if you have questions!

### current work

- building search engines based on word embeddings at [haave](https://www.haave.io) (aka *muh job*, ðŸ˜Ž)
